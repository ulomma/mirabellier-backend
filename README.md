This is the backend for my little corner of the web.

It is a cozy-but-serious Express app that handles auth, data, uploads, share previews, and all the behind-the-scenes logic that keeps the frontend feeling smooth.

## Hiya!!

The frontend gets the sparkles, but this is the quiet engine room. It stores the content, protects auth sessions, syncs live-ish data, and makes sure the cute pages are backed by real behavior.

## What this backend does

- Serves blog posts, tags, comments, and likes
- Handles Discord OAuth login and httpOnly session cookies
- Stores and updates public profile data
- Powers the guestbook board with synced note positions
- Runs the Arena API (profile, collection, shop, fight, leaderboard)
- Runs Question of the Day APIs (current, answers, archive, admin queue)
- Serves shrine admin/content APIs and shrine SEO/share pages
- Serves anime and quote SEO/share pages + embed images
- Stores quote snapshots and MyAnimeList currently-watching snapshots
- Handles image uploads and optimization
- Generates sitemap data and supports IndexNow submission

## The stack

- Node.js
- Express 5
- SQLite with `better-sqlite3`
- Passport Discord
- Multer
- Sharp

## API base notes

Frontend usually calls this API at `/v1` (example: `http://localhost:3000/v1`).

This backend also accepts unprefixed routes because it normalizes `/v1/*` internally. So these are equivalent:

- `/v1/posts`
- `/posts`

## Running it locally

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd mirabellier-backend
npm install
```

### 2. Create `mirabellier-backend/.env`

Copy `.env.example` and fill in your values.

```env
PORT=3000
DB_FILE=./database.sqlite3
SESSION_SECRET=your-very-secret-value
OWNER_DISCORD_IDS=your_discord_user_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
MAL_CLIENT_ID=your_myanimelist_client_id
MAL_USERNAME=your_myanimelist_username
WEBSITE_BASE=https://mirabellier.com
INDEXNOW_KEY=your-indexnow-key
```

Useful optional vars are documented in `.env.example` (session cookie options, QOTD webhook options, MAL refresh interval, quote schedule, and IndexNow toggles).

### Arena character catalog

Arena card draws use the favorites-ranked local file at
`data/mal-characters.json`. Refresh it by scraping MyAnimeList:

```bash
cd mirabellier-backend
npm run scrape:mal:characters
```

The scraper checkpoints every 50 characters and resumes automatically. You can
override the catalog path if needed:

```env
MAL_CHARACTERS_FILE=./data/mal-characters.json
```

Card rarity follows the character's position in that ranked file: top 1% UR,
next 4% SSR, next 10% SR, next 25% R, and the remaining 60% C.

### 3. Start the server

For development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For a regular run:

```bash
npm start
```

With `PORT=3000`, the backend runs at `http://localhost:3000`.  
If `PORT` is missing, `app.js` falls back to `5000`.

## Useful scripts

- `npm run dev` - run backend with nodemon
- `npm start` - run backend normally
- `npm run generate:sitemap` - regenerate sitemap data
- `npm run scrape:mal:characters` - refresh the ranked local Arena character catalog
- `npm run migrate:card-rarities` - preview rank-based rarity updates for stored cards
- `npm test` - run Node tests

## If something feels broken

- Check `mirabellier-backend/.env` first
- If login fails, verify Discord app credentials + callback URL
- If frontend auth redirects look wrong, verify `FRONTEND_URL`
- If uploads fail, verify `IMAGES_DIR` path and file permissions
- If MAL endpoints fail, verify `MAL_CLIENT_ID` and `MAL_USERNAME`
- If data seems stale, make sure only one local process is writing the same SQLite DB
- If owner-only routes return 403, verify `OWNER_DISCORD_IDS`

## Why this repo exists

I wanted the backend to stay understandable while still doing real app work.
Soft attitude, practical behavior, and sturdy enough to keep adding new little features without turning into spaghetti.

# My Deployment

I deployed this Node.js backend application to an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server and configured it for continuous operation and secure public access.

## Deployment Stack

## Deployment Process

1. Cloned the backend repository onto an AWS EC2 server.
2. Installed the required Node.js dependencies.
3. Configured the application to run on port `3000`.
4. Used PM2 to keep the application running continuously.
5. Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy.
6. Configured UFW to control server access.
